    "One of the main challenges in ML-enabled systems is the presence of mismatches between different components, such as data science, software engineering, and operations. These mismatches can lead to failed systems and reduced performance. For example, using ML models trained on different data than what is encountered in the production environment can dramatically decrease their performance. To address these challenges, the post discusses the need for improved communication and information sharing among stakeholders."

These descriptors facilitate automated detection of mismatches during both design time and runtime. The post provides examples of mismatch categories, including computing-resource mismatch, data-distribution mismatch, API mismatch, test-data mismatch, and monitoring mismatch."

The study categorized the identified mismatches and assessed the importance of sharing information to avoid them. The findings highlighted the significance of communication and information sharing in preventing mismatches."

    "Collaboration between data scientists and software engineers in the development of ML-enabled systems presents unique challenges. These challenges involve aligning different approaches, addressing collaboration points, and integrating product and model components. The study identified collaboration challenges in requirements and planning, training data, and product-model integration. Recommendations include involving data scientists early, clarifying responsibilities, formalizing documentation, addressing data quality, and establishing clear quality requirements. By improving communication, documentation, engineering capabilities, and process alignment, collaboration on ML-enabled systems can be enhanced."
