## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/rtkiros/programming-2.git

week 1.2: Classes and Instances

Description: This project introduces the concept of classes and instances in object-oriented programming. It demonstrates how to define classes, create instances, and use class attributes and methods.

## Usage
To run the project, execute the following command in the terminal: python3 main.py

week 1.3: Multiple Class Interaction

Description: This project demonstrates the interaction between multiple classes in Python. 
It showcases how different classes can collaborate and communicate to accomplish a specific task or solve a problem. 
The project includes examples of class definitions, instance creation, and method calls to illustrate the concepts of object-oriented programming and class interactions.

## Usage
To run the project, execute the following command in the terminal: python3 module name

week 1.4: Generators and Map-Reduce

Description: This project explores the concepts of generators and map-reduce in Python. Generators are a powerful feature of Python that allow for lazy evaluation 
and efficient memory usage when dealing with large datasets. Map-reduce is a programming model commonly used for processing large volumes of data in a distributed computing environment. 
## Usage
To run the project, execute the following command in the terminal: python3 module name

week 2.1: Network operations
Description: This project focuses on network operations and explores various concepts related to networking in Python. 
It covers topics such as making HTTP requests, working with APIs, socket programming, and network troubleshooting. 

## Usage
To run the project, execute the following command in the terminal: python3 module name

week 2.2: Parallellisation

Description: This project focuses on parallelization techniques in Python and explores methods to optimize the performance of computationally intensive tasks by leveraging parallel processing. 
It covers concepts such as multiprocessing, multithreading, and distributed computing.
## Usage
To run the project, execute the following command in the terminal: python3 module name

week 2.5: Parallellisation
Description: This project focuses on using Dask, a parallel computing library, for efficient and scalable analysis of protein data. The project aims to leverage the distributed computing capabilities of Dask to process and analyze large-scale protein datasets.
The analysis of protein data often involves computationally intensive tasks such as sequence alignment, structure prediction, and protein-protein interaction analysis. These tasks can be time-consuming when performed sequentially on large datasets. By employing Dask, we can distribute the workload across multiple cores or machines, 
enabling faster and more efficient analysis.

## Usage
To run the project, execute the following command in the terminal: run each code section of the notebook
